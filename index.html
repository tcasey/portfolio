<p class="first-p">Currently I'm attending the University of Utah as an Information Systems student. I aspire to become a software engineer and have decided to step up my web development game to the next level, thanks <b>thinkful</b>! I'll be the first to admit that I'm a nerd but hopefully it'll pay off by putting some good money in my pocket. As for my interests, as a child  I always had an interest engineering. I'd take things apart to see how they worked and then put them back together. Withnin the last couple years I got into road biking and I absolutely love it. What once started as an affordable means of transportation, has transformed into a full out passion. Now I strive to combine all these passions with my new found love, coding</p>
	
<p>I was born in Napa California where most of my family still resides. When I was about 2 my family moved to a small town in central California where I spent the majority of my life. After highschool I made the decision to serve a mission in Honduras, I was there for 2 years. Currently I'm residing in Salt Lake City, UT and have hopes of being able to move to Washington/Oregon after school.</p>

<p>My background is mainly business oriented. I have my AS degree in accounting and then decided to combine my two loves for my undergraduates degree, business and coding. Now I'm an <b>Information Systems</b> student and I'm loving it!</p>
